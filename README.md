# portfolio
A revamped portfolio website. This is the fruits of my labor. (This is very old lmao)

Goals in the future to improve it (very far future)
- [ ] Include more interactive elements/graphic elements
- [ ] Replace projects with better ones hopefully
- [ ] Perhaps update the "Sport" photo with a better one
- [ ] Add a nice "Word Cloud" showing all the technologies I use and am familiar with (interactive cuz it turns a brighter color when each word is highlighted)
- [ ] Add a tidbit on academics bring up (PSAT, GPA and math class)
